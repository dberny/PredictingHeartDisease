### How Best to Predict Heart Disease

Diego Berny and Anna Griffin

Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Machine learning can help predict weather or not the disease is present given health records and cardiovascular statistics. Using a logistic regression model, the accuracy score of 0.889. Other classification methods did not prove to be much better than the baseline logistic regression model. Feature engineering also did not show much improvement to the performance of our model. Dropping less important data to minimize unnecessary data and binning numerical data to reduce noise also did not have an overwhelming effect on our model with a AUC score of 0.0873, just below our baseline score.
